# Zebra Compiler — Bug Tracker

Running triage list. Updated each milestone. Format: severity (blocker/high/medium/low), status (open/fixed/deferred), and milestone target.

## Open Bugs

### BUG-001: ~~Shared method calling shared method emits `self.` prefix~~ — FIXED
- **Status:** Fixed (prior session — TCO work fixed bare shared method calls)
- Was: `testHelper()` inside a shared method generated `self.testHelper()`.
- Now: emits `ClassName.methodName()` correctly for shared→shared calls.

---

### BUG-002: `guard` + `try_postfix` runtime error propagation
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** Open
- **Target:** 0.3 or 0.5 (source-mapped errors)
- **Symptom A (`guard_test`):** `checkPositive` raises inside a guard else block; top-level `try Main.main()` panics with `error: ZebraError`.
- **Symptom B (`try_postfix_test`):** `safeDiv(10,0)?` propagates through `main throws`; top-level panics. The test doesn't catch the error — it's testing propagation but exits non-zero.
- **Note:** Both are likely correct behavior for Zebra error semantics. The tests need `try/catch` wrapping to validate error propagation without panicking. Test quality issue + potentially a compiler issue with top-level error display.

### BUG-003: ~~HTTP `serve` fails on Windows with "comptime call of extern function"~~ — FIXED
- **Status:** Fixed 2026-04-09
- Was: `_Ctx` struct stored `handler: Handler` where `Handler = @TypeOf(handler)` is a bare function type (comptime-only in Zig). Made the entire struct comptime-only, so `page_allocator.create(_Ctx)` triggered the `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` comptime path.
- Fix: Declare `const _HFn = *const fn(HttpRequest) HttpResponse` and coerce `const _fn: _HFn = handler` before `_Ctx`. Store `handler_fn: _HFn` in `_Ctx` (fn-pointer = runtime type). Call `ctx.handler_fn(_req)` directly. All three HTTP routes verified working on Windows.

### BUG-004: `padLeft/padRight/center` — fill char `'*'` passed as string to `u8` param — FIXED this session
- **Status:** Fixed 2026-04-08
- Was: `_pad_left(s, n, "*", alloc)` failed — `"*"` is `*const [1:0]u8`, not `u8`.
- Fix: Changed pad helpers to accept `anytype` fill; added `_pad_fill` normaliser that handles both char literals (comptime_int) and 1-char strings (pointer).

## Library Files with No Entry Point (Expected "Failures")

These are not bugs — they're library files that can't run standalone:
- `MathUtils.zbr` — utility class, imported by `crossmod_*`, `use_test`, `transitive_test`
- `StringHelper.zbr` — utility class, imported by `transitive_test`

---

## Intentional Error Tests (Correct Behavior)

These fail WITH A COMPILER ERROR — that IS the test passing:
- `branch_infer_miss_test.zbr` — expects error for non-exhaustive branch
- `branch_missing_test.zbr` — expects error for missing variant
- `capture_error.zbr` — expects error for undeclared capture

### BUG-005: `{d:0>N}` format adds `+` prefix to positive `i64` in Zig 0.15 — FIXED
- **Status:** Fixed 2026-04-09
- **Context:** DateTime preamble `_dt_to_iso8601` and `_dt_format` used `i64` fields with `{d:0>N}` format spec. Zig 0.15.2 adds a `+` sign to positive signed integers when using fill-aligned format (e.g. `{d:0>4}` for `i64 = 1970` → `+1970`).
- **Fix:** Cast all date fields to unsigned types (`@as(u32, ...)`, `@as(u8, ...)`) before passing to `bufPrint`/`allocPrint`. Unsigned integers never receive a sign prefix.
- **Broader note:** This is a Zig 0.15 breaking change from 0.14. Any future preamble code that formats `i64` values with fill-aligned specs should cast to unsigned first.

---

### BUG-006: `zig"..."` expression statement emits double semicolon
- **Severity:** Low
- **Status:** Open
- **Target:** 0.5 (low priority)
- **Symptom:** `zig"some_stmt;"` inside a method body emits `some_stmt;;` — the zig literal already ends with `;`, and `genStmt` for `.expr` always appends another `;`.
- **Fix:** In the `.expr` case of `genStmt`, detect when the expression is a `zig_lit` ending with `;` and skip the trailing `;\n` append.

---

---

### BUG-007: `String + String` string concatenation not handled — FIXED
- **Status:** Fixed 2026-04-09
- **Was:** `+` operator on strings fell through to the numeric `else` branch in `genBinary`, emitting `(a + b)` which Zig rejects for `[]const u8`. TypeChecker also rejected `String + String` as arithmetic.
- **Fix:**
  - TypeChecker `inferBinary`: added `if (e.op == .add and lt == .string) break :blk .string` before the numeric guard.
  - CodeGen `genBinary`: added dedicated `.add` case — if left operand is string, emits `_str_concat(a, b, _allocator)`.
  - Preamble: added `_str_concat(a, b, alloc)` using `std.mem.concat`.
- **Note:** String concat was previously untested; all prior tests used interpolation `"${var}"` or `StringBuilder`. Now `greeting + ", " + name` style works.
