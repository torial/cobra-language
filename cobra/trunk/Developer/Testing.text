== Introduction

A quick way to test the compiler is:

	# unix
	cd CobraWorkspace/Source
	cobra -ert:yes Misc/hello.cobra

	# windows
	cd CobraWorkspace\Source
	cobra -ert:yes Misc\hello.cobra

Because the -ert/embed-run-time flag will cause the compiler to plow through
the standard library.


To run the test suite use:

	bin/testify
	bin\testify


== Thorough Testing

While the test suite is extensive, it does not cover some things such as
self-compilation, the appearance of the @help directive output and the
installer.

Below is a more thorough test sequence. This is especially important before
cutting releases, making new snapshots or when making large changes to the
compiler.

It's technically possible to automate this, but doing so would require
careful examination of the results at each step.

Windows users should change "/" to "\".
