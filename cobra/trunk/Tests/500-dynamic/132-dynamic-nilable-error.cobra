# In 2008-09, the return type of someDynamicExpr.foo was changed from dynamic to dynamic?
# It then became necessary to make dynamic? flexible at run-time
# This test case in its original form, no longer applies

class Test

	def main is shared
		x as dynamic?

		Original test:
		.takeDynamic(x)  # .not error. Argument 1 of method "takeDynamic" expects a non-nilable type (dynamic), but the call is supplying a nilable type (dynamic?).
#/
		# new test:
		expect ArgumentNullException
			.takeDynamic(x)

	def takeDynamic(x as dynamic) is shared
