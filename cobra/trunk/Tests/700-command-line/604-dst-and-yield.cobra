# testing that -detailed-stack-trace will not choke on methods that "yield"
# -dst relies on try...catch but there is the limitation that "Cannot yield a value in the body of a try block with a catch clause" per C#
# which is really probably more of a fundamental limitation of "yield". in other words, I don't picture that an IL backend would fix this
