# .skip. The idea in this test case is not currently accepted and may not ever be.


# The idea here is that if you say "x = nil" and later you say "x = 5" then the inferred type of x should be "int?"

class Test

		x = nil
		x = 5
		y as int? = 100
		x = y  # works because x is dynamic
		y = x  # same here
		# TODO: no real test here that x is an int?
