About Cobra
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cobra is a high-performance, rapid-development programming language.
It combines features from Python, C#, Objective-C, Eiffel and other languages
in order to boost developer productivity.

Cobra is open source under the MIT license.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows, Mac or Linux.

If you're on a Unix-like system (Mac, Linux, etc.), you have the wrong package.
This one is for Microsoft Windows systems.
See http://Cobra-Language.com/downloads/ for Unix-like packages.

If you're on Windows, you have the wrong package.
This one is for Unix-like systems.
See http://Cobra-Language.com/downloads/ for Windows packages.

Microsoft .NET 2.0 - Cobra can be used with or without the SDK installed.
 -or-
Novell Mono 2.6: http://www.mono-project.com/

    .NET:   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/

    Mono:   http://www.mono-project.com/


Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can put Cobra wherever you like in your file system.
But here are some tips:

On a Windows system, make a C:\Cobra directory and inside that put Cobra-0.9.0.
This means you would have:

    C:\Cobra\
        Cobra-0.9.0\
            bin\
            Samples\
            (etc)

Now put a "cobra.bat" somewhere in your PATH such as a C:\bin directory.
The contents should at least be:
@"C:\Cobra\Cobra-0.9.0\bin\cobra.exe" %*

You could also try:
@"C:\Cobra\Cobra-0.9.0\bin\cobra.exe" -color %*

If you would like Cobra to automatically open your editor on the file and line
number of the first compilation error, try this (or something similar for your
editor):
@"C:\Cobra\Cobra-0.9.0\bin\cobra.exe" -color -editor:uedit32_FILE/LINE %*

Now you can:
  * Use Cobra from anywhere. 
  * Easily install new versions by putting them in C:\Cobra and
    repointing cobra.bat. 
  * Easily "roll back" by repointing cobra.bat to a previous version.
  * Easily find your local copies of the Cobra Samples, How-To's and Reusables.

But on a UNIX/POSIX-type system such as Linux, BSD or Mac, you'll probably want
to run the 'install' script. There is a comment block inside it with further
instructions.


Running Cobra
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Windows:

To run:
    > cobra MyProgram.cobra
The source code extension is not required:
    > cobra MyProgram
To run again:
    > MyProgram.exe
To just compile:
    > cobra -c MyProgram
If cobra is not in your path:
    > \path\to\cobra MyProgram
To learn about all the options:
    > cobra -help

On Unix-like systems:

To run:
    $ cobra MyProgram.cobra
The source code extension is not required:
    $ cobra MyProgram
To run again:
    $ mono MyProgram.exe

Learning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See http://Cobra-Language.com/docs/

Those docs are not currently included in this package, so you have to
