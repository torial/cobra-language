Initializers are methods that are automatically invoked when an object is
created. (These are called "constructors" in some languages.)

The syntax to declare one is:

	cue init
		# code

	cue init(ARG as TYPE)
		# code

	cue init(ARG1 as TYPE1, ARG2 as TYPE2)
		# code

Some key points:

	* You can have 0 or more arguments.

	* If you declare no initalizers at all for a given class, Cobra will
	  provide one, public, parameterless initializer.

	* Initializers can be overloaded by the number and type of their arguments.

	* Initializers are public by default.

	* Initializers can say "base.init(ARGS)" to invoke a base init.

	* Initializers can say ".init" or ".init(ARGS)" to invoke a fellow init.

	* Initializers can have their own unit tests just like methods.

# below are unrelated classes that demonstrate initializers:

class Speaker
	"""
	The Speaker declares no explicit initializer, but you can still create
	Speaker objects.

	test
		sp = Speaker()  # <-- making an object
		sp.speak  # <-- using that object

		print 'Hello'
