google-api.cobra


This command line program demonstates how to programmatically execute Google searches.

BUT on Apr 19, 2006, I can get no search results for it. When I visited the
Google Group that discusses this API (google.public.web-apis) I found some
disturbing complaints:

* One poster is getting no search results.
* The API results are very different from the human interface results.
* Another poster was informed by Google that requests to use the API in production
  applications are no longer being accepted, and the poster points out that the API
  has not been moved out of its original "Beta" status from 2002. It may not have
  even been updated since then.


HOW TO RUN

- Using the Google Web APIs requires a license key which you can get for free here:
    http://www.google.com/apis/

> cd path\to\Cobra\Examples

- Create a google-key.text file with your Google Web APIs license key.

> google-api "stock tips"


HOW TO BUILD FROM SCRATCH

> cd path\to\Cobra\Examples

- Launch a .NET SDK prompt and issue:
> wsdl.exe http://api.google.com/GoogleSearch.wsdl

- Open GoogleSearchService.cs and:
  - Add a capitalized method version of doGoogleSearch():
    public GoogleSearchResult DoGoogleSearch(string key, string q, int start, int maxResults, bool filter, string restrict, bool safeSearch, string lr, string ie, string oe) {
    	return doGoogleSearch(key, q, start, maxResults, filter, restrict, safeSearch, lr, ie, oe);
    }
  - Capitalize the properties of class GoogleSearchResult
  - Capitalize the properties of class ResultElement

> cobra --compile google-api.cobra GoogleSearchService.cs

- Then go to HOW TO RUN above


TODO
	[ ] parameterize some of the Google options
	[ ] add MSN support
	[ ] number the results
	[ ] Handle this with some retries:
Unhandled Exception: System.Net.WebException: Unable to connect to the remote server ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: A connect
ion attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed becaus
e connected host has failed to respond
