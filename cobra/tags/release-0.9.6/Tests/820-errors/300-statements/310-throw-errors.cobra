class X

	sig FooSig

	event foo as FooSig

	def main is shared
		throw Exception  # .error. Try instantiating it
		throw X  # .error. Also, this type does not inherit from Exception
		throw X()  # .error. because it does not inherit from Exception
	
	def bar
		throw .foo  # .error. it is an event, not an exception
