# .args. -debug

# This test covers:
# * That Cobra executables have the correct filname and line number embedded in them (see SharpWriter.cobra)
# * That passing -debug to cobra results in stack traces that have file name and line number information.
# * On Mono, that passing -debug to cobra also passes --debug to mono when running the program.


# non-debug stack trace:   at Test.Main () [0x00000] 
# debug stack trace:   at Test.Main () [0x00022] in /Users/chuck/Projects/Cobra/Workspace-Misc/Source/foo.cobra:5
#                or:   at Test.Main () [0x00022] in /Users/chuck/Projects/Cobra/Workspace-Misc/Source/foo.cobra:line 5
