"""
Strangely this code would work if `b` was set to any of the first four enums,
but if set to `flan` or later, it would throw the exception:

	System.InvalidCastException: Value is not a convertible object: System.Int32 to Test+MyEnum

The failure happened in CobraImp.DynamicCompare which calls Convert.ChangeType which is apparently fickle regarding enums!
Same behavior on both Mono and .NET

A special case in CobraImp.DynamicCompare was required to make this work
